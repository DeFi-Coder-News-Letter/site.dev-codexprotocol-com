# @TODO

- address various inline `@TODO` comments
- put in a section about gas allowances (update #gas-allowance links if section name changes)
  - maybe this should be a "miscellaneous concepts" section to talk about stuff
    like historical provenance, gas allowance, the zero address, the two-step
    transfer process, whitelisted addresses, ERC-721 etc
- ensure all links have anchors
