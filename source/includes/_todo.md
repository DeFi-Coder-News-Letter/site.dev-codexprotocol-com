# @TODO

- write about access token expiration in the [access tokens](#access-tokens) section
- address various inline `@TODO` comments
- put in a section about gas allowances (update #gas-allowance links if section name changes)
  - maybe this should be a "miscellaneous concepts" section to talk about stuff
    like historical provenance, gas allowance, the zero address, the two-step
    transfer process, ERC-721 etc
- theme the stylesheets to be more codex-y? (see `source/stylesheets/_overrides.scss`)
- ensure all links have anchors
  - zero-address
  - gas-allowance
  - modify-an-existing-record
  - create-a-codex-record
  - historical-provenance
  - transferring-a-codex-record
