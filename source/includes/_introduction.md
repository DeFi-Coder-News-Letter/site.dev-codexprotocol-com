# Introduction

Welcome to The Codex API documentation! Among other things, you can use our API
to create Codex Records on the Ethereum Blockchain without the need for any
direct blockchain interaction.

To use The Codex API, you will need to register an OAuth2 application with us.
Please see the [Authentication](#authentication) section for more information.

<aside class="notice">
  For the sake of brevity, all JavaScript code examples in this documentation
  assume the use of a convenient HTTP request library (e.g.
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request" target="_blank">request</a>).
  Of course, you're free to make requests to The Codex API in any manner you see
  fit.
